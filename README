Syntax: xfce4-build.sh command [packages...]

commands:
init      - download all needed packages from the GIT server
update    - runs 'git pull' on all package subdirectories
clean     - runs 'make clean' on all package subdirectories
distclean - runs 'make distclean' on all package subdirectories
build     - runs 'configure', 'make' and 'make install' on all package subdirectories
echo      - just prints all package modules

The commands update, clean, build and echo takes as second argument a comma separated list of package names, e.g.
xfce4-build.sh build apps/midori apps/gigolo
(this is useful if you updated all packages and there were only changes in some packages, so you don't have to rebuild all packages)
If the second argument is omitted, the command takes all packages.


The script's behaviour can be changed by setting different environment variables:

PREFIX - the prefix where to install the packages to, default: ./install
BUILDIT - the full path to the included script "buildit", default: buildit
LOG - filename to use for logging of stdout of the various build commands, default: /dev/stdout
ERROR_LOG - filename to use for logging of stderr of the various build commands, default: /dev/stderr
SKIP - a space separated list of packages to skip when updating/building/cleaning
